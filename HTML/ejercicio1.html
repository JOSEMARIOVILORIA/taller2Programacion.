    <h1>What is XML</h1>

    <li>
        XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage
    </li>
    <li>
        XML is a <strong>markup language</strong> much like HTML 
    </li>
    <li>
        XML was designed to <strong>describe data</strong>
    </li>

    <li>
        XML tags are not predefind. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        XML uses <strong>Document Type Definition</strong> (DTB) or an <strong>XML Schema</strong> to describe the data
    </li>
    <li>
        XML with A DTD or XML Schema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong>
    </li>

    <h2>The main difference between XML and HTML</h2>

    <p><strong>XML was designed to carry data</strong></p>

    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML. <br> XML and HTML were designed with different goals: </p>
    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is. <br>HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>
    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>XML does not designed to DO anything</h3>
    <p>Maybe it is little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created <br> to structure, store and to send information.</p>
    <p>The following example is note to Tove from Jani, store as XML:</p> 
    <img src="../recursos/imagenes/imagendetaller.png" alt="">
    <p>The note has a header and a message body. it also has sender and receiver information. <br>But still, this XML document does not DO anything. <br>it is just pure information wrapped in XML tags. Someone must write a plece of software to send, receive or display it. </p>
